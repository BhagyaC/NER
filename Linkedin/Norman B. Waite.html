Education
 
     Ph.D., Johns Hopkins
     Dissertation in stochastic optimal
     control.  Published peer-reviewed
     research in optimization.
 
Concentrations
 
     Experience in applied math,
     optimization, applied probability,
     statistics, artificial intelligence,
     and computing.
 
     Peer reviewed publications in
     optimization, mathematical
     statistics, computer science, and
     artificial intelligence.
 
     Published peer-reviewed paper with
     apparently the world's first
     collection of statistical hypothesis
     tests both multi-dimensional and
     distribution free.  The tests are
     useful in a wide variety of problems
     in anomaly detection and monitoring
     with a lot of data on many variables.
     Work based on some group theory and
     measure theory with an application of
     the classic result of S. Ulam that
     LeCam called 'tightness'.
 
     Optimization:  Linear, network
     linear, linear integer,
     multi-objective, quadratic, convex,
     nonlinear, dynamic optimization.
     Lagrangian relaxation.
 
     Dissertation work in stochastic
     optimal control included
     identification and formulation of
     practical problem, derivations with
     theorems and proofs including careful
     attention to measurable selection,
     high performance software with
     several novel approaches to
     performance (got execution time down
     from some decades to a few minutes),
     and interesting results.
 
     Dissertation advisor, J. Cohon, until
     recently, President at CMU.  Work
     from a three word suggestion from G.
     Nemhauser.  Work influential in at
     least one other Ph.D. dissertation
     under Cohon.  Much of the mathematics
     from A. Karr, star student of E.
     Cinlar.
 
     Publication in constraint
     qualifications for Kuhn-Tucker
     conditions solving some long
     outstanding problems including one
     posed in the famous paper by Arrow,
     Hurwicz, and Uzawa.  Work presented
     and made use of a new result
     comparable with the classic Whitney
     extension theorem.
 
     Digital signal processing:  Digital
     filtering, time series, power
     spectral estimation, the fast Fourier
     transform.
 
     Numerical linear algebra:
     Double-precision inner product
     accumulation and iterative
     improvement, numerically exact matrix
     inversion with single precision
     arithmetic from number theoretic
     techniques.
 
     Statistics:  Wide variety of
     techniques in applied statistics --
     hypothesis testing, multivariate
     methods, resampling.  Found a solid
     solution to the long outstanding
     problem of 'over fitting' -- solution
     applies in a significant fraction of
     the real cases.
 
     Computing:  Several systems,
     languages, many algorithms,
     applications.  Most recent work on
     Windows with the .NET Framework with
     ASP.NET, ADO.NET, SQL Server, TCP/IP,
     etc.
 
     E.g., in a hurry, designed, wrote,
     and used software to schedule the
     fleet at FedEx -- founder, COB, CEO
     Smith, the BoD, and investor General
     Dynamics were all pleased, company
     saved.  CEO Smith can confirm.
 
     While supporting self and spouse
     through our Ph.D. degrees at Johns
     Hopkins, the US Navy wanted an
     evaluation of the survivability of
     the US SSBN fleet under a special
     scenario of global nuclear war
     limited to sea.  Saw a continuous
     time Markov process subordinated to a
     Poisson process, with a quite good,
     easy Monte Carlo solution, and
     designed, wrote, and used software.
     Work passed peer-review from
     Professor J. Keilson.  Navy got
     their results in the two weeks.  Work
     later sold to a leading US
     intelligence agency.
 
     Found a solution to the problem of
     scheduling detail persons in
     pharmaceutical marketing.  Formulated
     the solution as least cost flows on a
     network with integer arc capacities
     -- in this way get integer
     programming for free.  Wrote software
     based on W. Cunningham's 'strongly
     feasible' modification.
 
     Solved a problem in 0-1 integer
     linear programming of allocation of
     marketing resources.  Problem had
     40,000 constraints and 600,000
     variables.  Derived, used, and
     programmed solution based on
     Lagrangian relaxation using the IBM
     Optimization Subroutine Library
     (OSL).  In 905 seconds on an old 90
     MHz PC, found a feasible solution
     guaranteed to be within 0.025% of
     optimality.
 
     Some engineers wanted to simulate a
     system under noise with measured
     power spectrum.  Since their
     frequency band of interest was quite
     low, standard material, e.g., in
     Blackman and Tukey, showed that they
     needed an especially long stream of
     input data.  Quickly wrote software
     illustrating the point, e.g., plotted
     the estimates of the power spectrum
     over and over as the stream of input
     data grew and, thus, illustrated, and
     confirmed the mathematics for, how
     much data was necessary for an
     accurate estimate of the power
     spectrum.  Engineers were pleased,
     and our company won a development
     contract.
 
     More such successes.
