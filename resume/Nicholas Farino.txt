Cornell University’s Violet Nanosatellite Team	  	  2014 – Present	  
Academic Experience 
Violet is a nanosatellite, set to launch May 2016, that utilizes eight Control Moment 
Gyroscopes to experimentally validate high-agility attitude control and CMG steering laws. 
imulation/Multi-disciplinary Engineer 
Constructs program in Matlab/Simulink that simulates space environment and spacecraft 
dynamics in order to assess ability of Violet’s flight computer to receive commands and control 
	  
satellite attitude. Programs flight computer used to control satellite attitude in C. 
	  
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  Generated and prepared over 20 failure scenarios for simulation to test	  
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  Implemented extended kalman filter and sensor noise reduction into flight computer	  
ornell University’s AguaClara Research Team	  	  June – December 2014	  
	  C
AguaClara is a multi-disciplinary program that designs sustainable water treatment systems 
committed to long-term environmental, social, and economic sustainability. 
	  S
	  
	  
 
	  
Organized product requirements and deadlines for team of six in order to design filter that did 
not clog when filtering muddy water conditions. Conducted experiments and analyzed data in 
	  
order to find conditions such that the design would not clog. 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  Used self-written data analysis algorithm to identify properties and trends in large 
experimental data sets
