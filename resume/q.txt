Obtaining full-time position in Machine Learning/Data Mining/Algorithms.
My research spans machine learning, compressive sensing, and randomized algorithms in numerical
linear algebra. Speciﬁcally, I am working on various probabilistic techniques to sample a small
number of elements from a matrix to perform tasks such as sparsiﬁcation (producing a sparse matrix
from fully observed data) and reconstruction (recovering the original matrix from partially-observed
data). These methods are useful in eﬃcient large-scale data analysis (e.g. social networks analysis,
bioinformatics, image processing, text/web mining) and matrix completion (e.g. recommendation
systems).
