eural Network Classifier for signal modeling and classification                     
  Goal of project is to develop a classifier using Neural Network structure 
  Designed and implemented Neural Network structure  in ‘C’ programming using Backpropagation algorithm 
  Used Gradient Descent Algorithm to train and validate network structure and found an optimum configuration 
for signal modeling and classification 
  Developed  graphical  user  interface  for  user  to  set  inputs parameters,  desired  output,  hidden  layers,  hidden 
nodes in each layer, learning rate and to re-randomize 
omparison of Image Blur Reduction Techniques 
 
Inertial Sensor Approach 
  Developed and implemented inertial sensor approach using PSF and Wiener filter in MATLAB 
  Generated Point Spread Function (PSF) for the blurred images 
  Used PSF with Wiener filter to achieve de-blurred image 
  Objective and Subjective analysis were done on the 50 resulting de-blurred images 
xposure Control Approach 
  Used dark looking image with low exposure setting and blurred image with brightness and contrast. 
  Adaptive Tonal Correction is performed by using the information in the blurred image to achieve de-blurring 
  Tonal  correction  performs  histogram  shifting  by  moving  the  mean  of  the  darker  input  image  towards  the 
brighter side of the histogram 
  Objective and Subjective analysis were done on the 50 resulting de-blurred images
